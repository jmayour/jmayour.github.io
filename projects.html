          Human mesenchymal stem cell delivery has exhibited potential in clinical myocardial infarction therapies; however, the large scale application of this method is limited by the fact that researchers do not fully understand the mechanisms by which mesenchymal stem cells enhance cardiomyocyte function. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool that can predict how mesenchymal stem cells interact with cardiomyocytes. Therefore, to better understand the electrical role of mesenchymal stem cells, three novel electrophysiology models were developed. Significant electrophysiological consequences were evident when the ten Tusscher model was coupled to each of the mesenchymal stem cell models in ratios of 9:1, 4:1, and 1:1, respectively. These effects include decreases in action potential duration and plateau height, and corresponding variations in ionic current. Furthermore, there was a decrease in conduction velocity and maximum upstroke velocity. These consequences correspond to established in vitro electrical effects, and show mesenchymal stem cells are capable of predisposing re-entrant arrhythmias. A sensitivity analysis on the mesenchymal stem cell inputs shows the robustness of the results. Overall, this model provides promising insight into the electrical interactions between the two cells types, and can be used in future studies to optimize conditions for mesenchymal stem cell therapy.

          The influenza virus causes approximately 17,000 to 51,000 deaths a year in the U.S. alone, and could potentially cause over a million deaths globally. This pandemic therefore is a global health and economic concern, making it of interest to develop a vaccine. Specifically, a new trivalent flu vaccine will be developed using SF9 insect cells for influenza A, B-hemagglutinin, and B-neuraminidase. We seek to produce 50 million doses of flu vaccine, which is approximately one-third of the total flu vaccine distributed during the 2013-2014 influenza season in the United States. To develop this trivalent flu vaccine, a non-traditional disposable approach will be taken, with the following steps: 1) preparing media and buffer; 2) expanding cells by a seed train where cells are multiplied; 3) producing vaccine by by innoculating the cells with the recombinant Baculovirus; 4) recovering the contents and products via centrifugation and filtration; 5) inactivating the virus; 6) capturing and purifying the vaccine of interest; and 7) concentrating and stabilizing the material for shipping. Accounting for the cost of each of these steps, the cost of good sold is $0.08 per dose. For a plant life of 8 years, a dosage price as low as $0.44/dose is required to obtain a rewarding investment rate of return of 25% and total profit of $60 million. Current egg-based versions of the flu vaccine require a dosage price as high as $0.64/dose to obtain a similar investment rate of return and total profit. With our design at a selling price of $0.64/dose, it is possible to achieve an investment rate of return as large as 42%, and a total profit of $120 million.

          Radiofrequency ablation is typically used to heat up malignant liver tissue to critical temperatures in order to kill cancerous cells. However, this hyperthermic process also has noticeable effects on the microvasculature of tumor tissue (i.e. capillary blood vessels). Specifically, it has been empirically shown that heating up cancerous tissue also affects blood flow and oxygen transport. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to analyze and control blood flow and oxygenation as a function of transient temperature rise within tissue. Therefore, in this study, a mathematical model was developed via COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the effects of radiofrequency ablation on blood flow and oxygen transport within tumor tissue. It was determined that the application of radiofrequency ablation on cancerous liver tissue for 60 seconds increases the average temperature of the tumor tissue from 37&degC to 43&degC. The hyperthermic effects of radiofrequency ablation subsequently resulted in an increase of capillary blood vessel radius by 30%, an increase in blood flow velocity by 70%, and an increase in overall oxygenation. This study shows that radiofrequency ablation can potentially be coupled with chemotherapy to enhance the efficacy of delivering pharmacological agents.

          Regenerative therapy is one of many techniques used to combat disease in neuroscience and cardiology. To improve regenerative therapeutics, it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms and physiological effects of natural blastema regeneration. Therefore, the conduction velocity of an earthworm animal model was studied to crudely understand the physiological effects of natural blastema regeneration. Specifically, electrophysiological recordings were generated on both intact and regenerated anesthetized earthworms via PicoScope and PicoLog. The conduction velocity of intact and regenerated earthworms was calculated as 18.9 m/s +/- 9.0 m/s and 15.5 m/s +/- 6.2 m/s, respectively. These results indicate no significant difference can be drawn on intact and regenerated earthworm conduction velocities. It was also noted that the magnitude of action potentials increased following regeneration, which was not expected. Therefore, the mechanism resulting in a greater action potential magnitude will be examined in the future. The use of an effective procedure to investigate the electrophysiological properties of intact and regenerated earthworm gives potential to also investigate other earthworm electrical properties in the future.

          Recent animal studies and clinical trials indicate the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for myocardial therapy. However, the predominant mechanisms of MSC improvement of cardiac function remain unresolved.  Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) offer a powerful tool for investigation of MSC-cardiomyocyte interactions since the environment is well controlled, with greater biofidelity than standard 2D cell culture.  Using a novel multi-tissue ECT culture system to separate the effects of soluble factors from direct cell-cell interactions, the hypothesis that MSC-mediated enhancement of cardiomyocyte contractile function is dominated by paracrine signaling mechanisms was tested. An increase in developed twitch stress in myocyte-only tissues from 0.113 +/- 0.051 kPa (mean +/- SD) in the absence of co-culture tissues to 0.304 kPa in the presence of co-culture ECTs was found at culture day 5, suggesting an early paracrine signaling effect; but the enhancement was not evident at day 10.

          Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) offer a powerful tool for investigation of MSC-cardiomyocyte interactions since the environment is well controlled, with greater biofidelity than standard 2D cell culture. However, current bioreactor designs result in limited engineered cardiac tissue throughput. Furthermore, these bio-devices aren't capable of measuring engineering cardiac tissue activity at varying tissue lengths. Therefore, a novel length-controlled bioreactor was designed on Solidworks to increase throughput by six-fold. This bioreactor could be used to test paracrine signaling. In the case shown, alternating CM only ECTs (yellow) and CM-hMSC ECTs (orange) are developed using this bioreactor.

          An ethylene production plant was designed to meet a product specification of 700 metric tons per day. To do so, 140,010 lb/hr of 100% butane is fed to the plant, and 100% of ethane is recycled at a rate of 8,174 lb/hr. This plant process includes: a furnace (to crack the hydrocarbon feed), a quench tower (to cool the exiting stream), a four stage compressor system (to increase the pressure of the cracked gases), a refrigeration section (to cool the stream to cryogenic temperatures), and a five tower fractionation system (to separate the remaining products). The resulting ethylene, propylene, gasoline, and high pressure stream products are subsequently sold. An economic analysis was performed on the ethylene plant designed, where it is expected that the plant will profit approximately 160 million over a 10 year operation period, with a return on investment of 16%. It was assumed for the economic analysis that the plant will run 8,400 hours a year (0.96 plant operating factor). This promising return on investment makes it sensible to perform more rigorous economic studies, and to potentially go forward in the plant construction. The capital investment for the plant construction was $248,000,000. The utilities to run the compressors and pumps, including low pressure steam, cooling water, and electricity, cost approximately $16,000,000 per year. To reduce unnecessary utility costs, certain process streams were used for heating and cooling. Since it is assumed that wage costs are $4.5 million per year, the total annual operating cost is $20,500,000 per year.

          Hydrocarbon pyrolysis via thermal cracking produces ethylene, propylene, butadiene and aromatics, which are predominant feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. Our study optimizes the profit on the thermal cracking process of ethane to ethylene using a tubular reactor. Ethylene, ethane, and inert gases are fed into a tubular reactor at a temperature and pressure we can select. Furthermore, we can select the length, diameter, and constant wall temperature of the tubular reactor.In this study, we assume that the inner diameter of the reactor is 0.1 m, which is approximately the inner diameter of a 4 inch schedule 80 stainless steel pipe. Furthermore, we require that the inlet inert and ethylene feed conditions are 30% of the total feed and 1 mol/s, respectively. We also requires that the single tubular reactor will fit in a 100 m by 1 m confined area. Therefore, the remaining decision variables are feed temperature, constant wall temperature, feed pressure, tube length, and ethane molar feed. To solve this cost-optimization problem, we formulated a constrained, nonlinear programming problem. The optimal profit (neglecting capital cost) is $3.60/s, which is equivalent to over $112,000,000 per year, when the feed temperature, constant wall tem- perature, feed pressure, tube length, and ethane molar feed are 1050&degC, 1050&degC, 4.3 atm, 100 m, and 500 mol/s, respectively. This profit is much greater than the profit using previous conditions at our company, where we profited less than $22,000,000 per year. A sensitivity analysis indicates that only by varying the parameters greatly will there be drastic change in our optimal solutions.
